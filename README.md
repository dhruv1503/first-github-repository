  ##Some important Git commands 
1. clone : This command is used to bring a repository that is hosted somewhere to the likes of version control systems sych as github, gitlab, bitbucket etc into folder to a local machine.
2. add : This command is used to track all the files and changes in the particular git.
3. commit : Saves our files in the git.
4. push : Upload git command to remote repo like github, gitlab
5. pull : Download changes from remote repository to the local machine, opposite of push
